Project: DigestWell

Project Description: a tracker for IBD patients. It tracks food, beverages, symptoms and bowel movements.

1. Run the project:
   You will have to hard code a user ID in the users database

2. The app login section is fake (this explains the need for a hard-coded user ID)

3. The possibility to edit cards that only have symptoms or stool type edit is not working yet. Maybe you will need to redesign the way the Entry component works with smaller components. That's what I wish to do after the bootcamp.

4. The backend needs to be updated to make point 3 work (the edit).

5. The responsiveness of the project is not finished yet.

6. The use of MUI makes this project a mess at the moment.

7. The router.jsx is not used anymore. I initially built it before realizing that I needed context (used in App.jsx) to pass information to pages/MyLists. I have not removed router.jsx yet because I might need to use it in the future (not sure about that).
