1. Run the project:
You will have to hard code a user ID in the users database

2. The app login section is fake (this explains the need for a hard-coded user ID

3. The symptoms and stool type edit is not working yet. I think there is a need to create smaller components for the Entry component.

4. The responsiveness of the project is not finished yet.

5. The use of MUI makes this project a mess at the moment.
